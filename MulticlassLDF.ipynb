      "# Classification with Label Dependent Features\n",
      "\n",
      "In the [MulticlassClassification]() notebook, we saw how to build classifiers whose output is one of K classes. In those examples, each class was treated as an atomic unit: class 1 had no more to do with class 2 than it did with class 65. In some cases, you want to associate features with the different classes (or labels): this gives rise to **label dependent feature** models. (These are also useful to [zero-shot learning](#zeroshot), which we'll see later in this notebook.)\n",
      "\n",
      "## Formalism and Data Format\n",
      "\n",
      "A natural problem where LDF arises is in search ranking-like problems. Here, the input to the system is a query (like \"vowpal wabbit ldf howto\") and the output is one of the billion-or-so documents on the web. It doesn't make a lot of sense to give each document on the web a unique id and then try to learn a mapping from inputs (queries) to outputs (documents), treating all documents independently. Instead, what you *want* to do is associate a feature vector with a *pair* $(x,y)$, where $x$ is the query and $y$ is a hypothetical returned document. This feature vector might do things like count how many of the query terms are present in the corresponding document.\n",
      "\n",
      "The associated LDF learning problem is: given some $x$ (query) and a set of possible retreived documents $(y_1, y_2, \\dots, y_K)$, we want to compute $\\arg\\min_k f( \\varphi(x,y_k) )$, where $\\varphi(x,y_k)$ is the features you extract for that pair, and $f$ is the learned \"cost\" function. *[Note: sometimes people talk about a \"score\" function that we try to maximize rather than a \"cost\" function that we try to minimize. Here, we'll talk only about costs, so lower is always better.]*\n",
      "\n",
      "The basic data format (we'll see briefer alternatives later) for LDF is something like the following:\n",
      "\n",
      "    1:1 | features for pair (x1,y1) ...\n",
      "    2:0 | features for pair (x1,y2) ...  <-- this is the correct \"label\"\n",
      "    3:1 | features for pair (x1,y3) ...\n",
      "    4:1 | features for pair (x1,y4) ...\n",
      "    <blank line>\n",
      "    1:0 | features for pair (x2,y1) ...  <-- this is the correct \"label\"\n",
      "    2:1 | features for pair (x2,y2) ...\n",
      "    5:1 | features for pair (x2,y5) ...\n",
      "    <blank line>\n",
      "    \n",
      "And so on. Here, each **block** of data is separated by a blank line. A single block corresponds to a single training example, and each line in that block corresponds to a valid prediction for that example. The \"label\" portion consists of a class identifier (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ...) and a cost (:1 means \"cost=1\" and :0 means \"cost=0\"). After that, any features that make sense can be written out.\n",
      "\n",
      "A few notes:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Costs can be any non-negative values, and there can be multiple labels with a cost of zero.\n",
      "1. The actual labels (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ...) are completely ignored by the learning algorithm. Everything you want to encode *must* be encoded in the features. If each line in a single block has exactly the same features, it will be impossible to differentiate them. This also means that label ids needn't be consistent across blocks.\n",
      "1. You don't have to use consecutive label ids (as in the second block above).\n",
      "\n",
      "## LDF for Quizbowl, Step 1\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm going to assume you've already gone through the [MulticlassClassification]() notebook and have downloaded the QuizBowl data. If not, do so now. Here is some code copied from before for loading the data."
